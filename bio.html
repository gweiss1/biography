				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I began working at Red Ventures in March 2017 as a sales agent and was able to start in the ITA Gateway program shorty after. I began my professional career as a clinical social worker, first as an Equine Professional practicing Trauma-Focused Equine Assisted Psychotherapy in Texas, and then as a social worker in a hospital emergency department conducting behavioral health screenings. While I enjoyed social work and learned a lot from it, I felt that it was not quite the right fit for me and decided to pursue a career in web development.</p>
				<p>I grew up in Seattle, WA, went to college in Rochester, NY, and after that moved to Austin, TX for graduate school. No matter where I have gone, horses have always been a huge part of my life. I rode competitively all throughout high school and college, and still ride today but unfortunately have less time for competitions.</p>
